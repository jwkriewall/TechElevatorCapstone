<!-- Create a new component called `BookDetails` that shows all of 
a book's details on the screen. A basic version would be something like this:

![Book Detail Page](./etc/book-detail-page.png)

Create a view and a dynamic route with the path `/book/` 
plus the `isbn` number on the endâ€”for example, `/book/9781400079278`. 
Use that number to look up the book for the `BookDetails` component.

Finally, link the `BookCard` components in the `ReadingList` component 
to this new route, making sure to have the book's `isbn` as part of the 
link when the `BookCard` is clicked. -->
